# Component Library

After learning some React, I feel like making an EJS component set for use in the latter stages of this project. Since a lot of the logic is coming to a close, having a robust front end component library feels nice to get this project to 100%. The backend is almost done, with a few crutial steps left, along with bugtesting. 

I plan on making the component library coming from both top down and bottom up, hopfully meeting in the middle somewhere. I need to figure out how to make a top level component to bring all my bottom level components together.
